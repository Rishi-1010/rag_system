When registering as a handyman, I am forced to choose a \u201cProvider\u201d profile, which appears to tie me to a company. This restriction raises several questions:\n... Why can\u2019t freelance handymen use the app independently?\n... What is the rationale behind mandatorry linking handymen to a company profile?\nSupporting independent handymen could significantly expand the app\u2019s user base and appeal. Freelance workers often operate without being tied to a company, and the app should cater to their needs by offering a dedicated profile type for them, with dedicated app section.Feature Suggestions:\n1. Custom Service Subscriptions:\n- Allow both company and handyman profiles to subscribe to specific service categories and set a radius for receiving job notifications. This would help users focus on relevant opportunities while enhancing user experience.2. Custom Job Posting Section:\n- Introduce a dedicated section in the app where users and guest users can view custom job requests posted by clients. This feature would encourage more individuals to create handyman profiles and take up jobs in their area, especially if they match their skills and availability.3. Pricing Plans:\nThe current plans feel underwhelming. Consider adding features that improve value for users, such as:\n... Limiting the number of bookings based on the plan tier.\n... Limiting the number of service categories on which ones is subscribed based on the plan tier.\n... Restricting the number of total services that can be configured for lower-tier plans.\n... Admin commissions or lower additional fees for higher-tier plans with more capabilities.Can this be implemented, and if so, can you contact me for a quote ?",

We understand the importance of supporting independent handymen and enhancing the app\u2019s features to provide a more inclusive and flexible experience.1) Independent Handyman Support:We agree that enabling freelance handymen to use the app independently would significantly broaden its appeal. We will include the option for a dedicated handyman profile in our future roadmap. This profile will not require linking to a company, ensuring flexibility for freelancers.2) Custom Service Subscriptions:Allowing subscription to specific service categories and setting a radius for job notifications is a fantastic idea. We will explore the feasibility and add it to our roadmap. For Custom Job Posting Section, A dedicated section for viewing and responding to custom job requests is valuable for connecting clients and handymen. We will include this in our roadmap and consider its implementation.3) Pricing Plan Enhancements:Your suggestions on improving pricing plans (e.g., limiting bookings, service categories, and additional fees) are excellent. We\u2019ll analyze how to integrate these features to make plans more compelling.We will include these suggestions in our development roadmap. If you require these features urgently, we can provide a customized solution.

I understand that you require an active support subscription through Envato for assistance, but I believe this issue might be related to the core functionality of the product, and not a custom implementation on my end.To investigate further, I downloaded and tested the demo app provided, and I experienced the same issue where the verification email was not sent. This strongly suggests that the problem exists within the core codebase of the application rather than being specific to my server or setup.The email verification process is a critical function for my platform, as it directly affects user registration. Without it, new user sign-ups are severely limited, which negatively impacts both the user experience and the growth of the platform. Therefore, resolving this issue is essential to ensure the application functions as intended for all users.I kindly request your assistance in reviewing this issue and providing guidance or a fix. It seems to be a fundamental issue that other users of your product might also encounter.Thank you for your understanding and support.",

This process would take them step by step through adding their first service and completing their profile as thoroughly as possible. While this feature should remain optional (with the ability to skip), it could have a huge impact.Currently, many providers sign up but leave their profiles and services incomplete. As a result, they remain invisible on the platform, and there\u2019s little to no interaction.

However, the money is sent to the provider only after the admin transfers it, following the user\u2019s confirmation.2. Yes, the app supports manual approval for service providers. Admins can verify and approve service providers before their accounts become active. Once approved, providers can log in to their dashboard, add services, and start receiving tasks.3. Yes, a provider can operate as a company and add their experts as handymen. When a service request is received, the provider can choose to assign the task either to themselves or to one of their handymen4. If your earning model is commission-based, the admin earns a percentage from each service. For example, if the provider\u2019s commission is set to 80%, the provider receives 80% of the service fee, while the remaining 20% goes to the admin.If the earning model is subscription-based, providers must purchase a subscription plan to offer their services and receive tasks. The earnings for the admin come from the subscription fees paid by the providers, which serve as the admin\u2019s revenue for accessing the platform and using its features.5. Currently, the app does not support the feature for customers to book and pay service providers per day, instead of per hour. This would require some modifications to the platform .6. The difference between a provider and a handyman is as follows:Provider: The provider is the main entity or business, typically a company or individual that can add services to the platform, receive direct booking requests from customers, and manage their own operations. Providers can set up their profile, list the services they offer, and handle the entire booking process. They are the primary point of contact for customers and can assign tasks to handymen working under them.Handyman: A handyman is a person who works under a provider but does not have the ability to list services or receive direct service requests from customers. They are assigned tasks by the provider based on the service requests that the provider receives. Handymen can perform the work, but they do not have the authority to manage their own bookings or services within the platform."

So every time the user books, it will be deducted from his/her wallet.In the admin level, I don\u2019t want commission-based revenue, just a booking fee. But the provider can still have a commission revenue feature. And this is different from the advance payment feature.The booking fee is deducted automatically after the service is booked, even before provider/handyman accepts it. If the provider/handyman rejects or cancels the job request, the fee will go back automatically in the user wallet.While the tax is being paid after the whole service process.This is a new revenue stream at the admin level. No commission fee, but only a flat rate booking fee. This feature can also solve the money transfer issue from the handyman to the admin. So if the user pays cash to the handyman, the handyman will not worry about sending cash to the Admin.What do you think?",

(this is very problematic).*_ Mobile version _1. Messages1.1 Instant messaging (when the user is in off-client or handyman mode, you can\u2019t send messages)\n1.1.1 Messaging, images and photos cannot be sent.\n1.1.2 Not instant messaging  \n1.1.3 messages cannot be deleted2. Payments2.1 Offline payment works, but the do-it-yourselfer or supplier can\u2019t validate, nothing happens!\n2.1 When paying either by card or offline, the system asks for payment a 2nd time! perhaps a syncro problem due to the slowness of the system.  \n2.2 Payments on the web version don\u2019t work either, the customer has no way to do it, he has to go through the mobile application.\n2.3 Offline payments for subscriptions (cheques, transfers, cash) really need to be made available \u2013 some supplier customers want this method of payment.Other functions- The request for work, it works, the customer can send his request, but nothing happens afterwards, I see it in the admin in the list that\u2019s all, what to do? we have no way of processing this request or assigning it to a supplier \u2026 and the customer is waiting for an answer.- We receive notifications, but there\u2019s nothing in the history!- We receive notifications, but there\u2019s nothing in the history!\n- Roles & permissions, you really need to check all this, for example for suppliers, normally they can\u2019t write a blog, it\u2019s unchecked in the admin and yet I can create a blog.- On the Web versions (admin, provider, handyman, customer) you can\u2019t intervene in the service, you can\u2019t start the work, you can\u2019t finalize it, you can\u2019t pay, you can\u2019t rate, nothing! you can just book and basta. it\u2019s very frustrating.\n- Very slow, even on the WEB version.- Don\u2019t forget to add Ads for providers with ad purchases (like your competitor Edemandium), a very practical feature.\n- We also need to work on website ergonomics, provider panel, handyman and especially admin (not very fluid).- Remember to save deleted profiles and keep them for a while (30 days or more) for greater security with triggers in the database.- Remember to translate all fields, including notifications, categories, sub-categories, etc. It\u2019s complicated on the application to have several languages in the same service.I\u2019m not going to add any more bugs related to the admin or the panels (suppliers, handymen), I think you know them.Thank you for taking my comments into consideration, I think the application is promising and it\u2019s a shame I\u2019m taking on your competitor, I know it\u2019s a lot of work.Thank you for your efforts. *",

Each provider can manage multiple handymen who perform the actual services.Handyman: Refers to individual service providers who work under a provider. They directly deliver services and specialize in specific areas like plumbing, electrical work, or cleaning.2) No, the admin cannot manually update bookings from the backend, but this functionality can be implemented through customization.3) Yes, we offer a post job request feature in our system. If a user cannot find a particular service on our platform, they can post a custom service job request. Once posted, nearby providers will be notified and can bid on the specific job request.4) Yes, our booking process allows users to book a specific service. Once a provider is notified, they can accept or cancel the request. If accepted, the provider can assign the job to themselves or their handyman, after which the user can start and complete the service.5) No, in our platform, each service is linked to a single provider.

With these additions and fixes, we can provide a much better experience for both the providers and the customers. Please make sure these are all included in the next update, as they will significantly impact our operations.Add Products to Booking: The most important feature is the ability for users to add products like cement, hair dye, or bricks to their booking. This way, the handyman can bring the necessary materials right away. Please prioritize this as it\u2019s critical for streamlining the service.Delivery and Ambulance Feature: Please also include the delivery and ambulance service feature that we\u2019ve discussed before.Fixing Bugs & Handyman Errors: Make sure all the bugs and inconsistencies I reported and confirmed with Nimesh B. are addressed in this update, especially the issues in the handyman module. These are preventing a smooth boot and need to be resolved as a priority.Commission System: Please confirm that the commission setup will be updated so that the provider has control over setting the commission for their handyman. Since it\u2019s their deal with the handyman, it makes sense for the provider to manage this. However, the admin should still be able to set a default platform commission, and the provider can then distribute the remainder accordingly.Service at Business Premises: Also, can you confirm that the \u201cService at Business Premises\u201d feature (similar to a kiosk setup) will be included in this update? It\u2019s important for those offering services at both home and business locations.Admin Management & Status Change: The admin should have more control over managing orders\u2014such as editing prices, handling cancellations, and changing service statuses without needing client approval. This will streamline operations significantly, so please make sure it\u2019s included in the update.Coupon Management: The coupon management system needs to be streamlined by adding an \u201cALL\u201d option, so we don\u2019t have to spend 20 minutes scrolling through endless options. This will make it much easier to manage multiple coupons.Customization, UI Enhancements & Admin Footer: I also like the idea of adding TinyMC for rich-text formatting in service details and improving admin panel customization (like adding a HEX code color changer). Additionally, please remove or make it possible to edit your name on the admin panel footer. It\u2019s important that our employees don\u2019t see \u201cIqonic\u201d displayed there.Subscription-Based Services: It would be great to include a feature where users can subscribe to recurring services (e.g., weekly room cleaning for one month). This would improve convenience for customers and boost engagement with repeat services.Multiple Service Bookings: Please implement the ability for users to book multiple services in one order. This will make the booking process more efficient and save customers time.Please confirm that all of these points will be taken care of in this upcoming update, especially the ability for the provider to set their own commissions and the service kiosk feature.Thanks!

Does the provider add his own handymen?2. How does provider or handyman get messaged about request? Apart from getting it by email, do do they also get a ping in their cellphone app, e.g., something like a beep or ding dong (in case they are not checking email regularly)?3. Can the apps be uploaded to both Play Store and IOS for both android and apple?Great job.",

Is it possible to add a late fee penalty when the provider for example arrives 15 mins late to the job site?\n4. Can providers upload videos/images for their portfolio to show proof of their work when making their account and setting up services?\n5. Can customers upload videos and images of the job site after the work has been done?\n6. Is it possible to completely turn off cash on delivery and set the app to online orders only to receive full payment deposits before the job gets done?\n7.

From what I am seeing, the app is designed for the Provider to create services & assign them to the handyman after approval. What if the provider is the handyman? For example a plumber, would the plumber need to have the service man app installed & the provider app installed then switch between apps to process orders? Is it possible to just disable the handyman feature and have everything run directly as provider? I.e create services, accept bookings, process bookings etc from ONE app?\n2. When a User(customer) makes a booking, is it possible to have google maps/ apple makes get their exact location for the order then when they handyman/provider accepts the order they can click to view the address and the maps comes up with directions to the location? (If this isn\u2019t a current feature, what would the custom work for this cost?)",

Is it possible to implement API for payoneer or other international banks to pay providers locally from any country? If not, what would the customization cost look like.\n4.

Kindly consider adding role-based filtering when the detected role is that of a provider eg (WHERE ProviderID = @ProviderID) as necessary to the relevant commands.You may wish to consider improving the Workflow (by default) to automatically assign the task to a Provider who has not registered any Handyman yet. As it\u2019s expected that any Provider who has handymen would have since registered them before he gets his first booking / order. That\u2019s a more intuitive, real-life as well as versatile way as it\u2019s more consistent with real world scenarios where the large number of providers are actually Freelancers (who have no staff).Thus having them always have to click around to assign to themselves what\u2019s already pretty obvious is not the most optimal implementation.

Currently, admins have to reach out separately to collect and update this info, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient for both parties.2) Please simplify the clock option to a simple hour and minute number based text box in the add services sections, as it has AM and PM with a clock phase which makes them look like its a time based service.3) Address in a textbox. User may enter random text which may not be correct, it would be a fine improvement, if you could utilise the maps API to pull Google map address when they type, similar to Uber and other location based apps.

Question is not on different commission rates for different providers. That is not an issue. My question is regarding the commission amount difference. Here if the admin has set for this provider as 30%, how are they making 70%. By this logic, admin will make more money than the provider because provider\u2019s money is going to admin and admin\u2019s money is going to provider. That is a major issue.2) I deleted all my previous order for this test. Here\u2019s the new issue:I added Rs.10,000 to wallet as a user, booked a vendor\u2019s gig order of Rs.10,000 by making advance payment of Rs.9500. Provider rejected the order. Now the money debited from the user account went back to the user. That\u2019s correct. But I booked the same gig of the provider again of Rs.10,000, and made the provider accept the order, finished the order by paying balance of Rs.500 as the user. Now in the earnings tab \u2013 It should show that the provider earned Rs.10,000 \u2013 30% ( admin commission) = Rs.7000, which is what I should payout, but it shows 20,000 as total earning, 14,000 as admin earning and 6000 as provider earning. How is this correct? The cancelled order is also added here and I\u2019m not able to correct this and I\u2019m not able to even payout the correct amount because the save button is greyed out if the amount is exactly as not in that table.Here\u2019s the screenshots:The cancelled order even shows as pending here, instead of rejected or cancelled:Screenshot 1:https://prnt.sc/vBfO2ZaEtjiRScreenshot 2:https://prnt.sc/P5ulYbzOeTHTScreenshot 3:https://prnt.sc/tsnEhxIwK61BEarnings page:https://prnt.sc/A1W3Y6J-FSo3",

I set provider\u2019s commission as 30%, but its showing admin revenue as 70% and provider earning as 30%.In the app also, it looks like we\u2019re charging the provider 30% of their earnings, but in reality the admin panel shows like we\u2019re charging 70%.A normal commission flow is 30% commission means, whatever provider earns -> admin takes a 30% cut and the remaining goes to the provider.

Here it shows 7700 as admin earning and provider earning as 3300. That\u2019s like 70% admin instead of 30%. Please check this.https://prnt.sc/cJDfEB9a5Yg-2) Similar to how another user reported here, the keyboard doesn\u2019t go down on the service proof page. If you select the proof page, title and then description, because the description design is long, anywhere you click, the keyboard stays up, but if you click the title again after typing the description, the keyboard goes. But no user will type the title, then description and then go click the title again to make the keyboard go away, because they can\u2019t upload the service proof button as that\u2019s under the keyboard. This is on iOS. Android works fine. Please check this.3) Advanced payment 100% is showing error. It shows the error message: Value should be in 1 to 100. Screenshot:https://prnt.sc/g_2yS4zl5cM94) If a provider declines a job request after accepting it, it currently gets deleted for the user, The job request needs to go back to the request pool automatically if a provider cancels it or the user has to keep adding the new request again and again until they find a provider, which is tiresome and no user will do.5) After order has started -> click on hold -> cancel. User shouldn\u2019t be able to just cancel the order after the provider started it. It should contact customer care or charge cancellation fees with 100% 50% or custom percent as cancellation. This current flow is not ideal in the real world. Provider shows up, user starts the order, holds the order and cancels the order ?6) After completing the order, the provider\u2019s home page dashboard on the app still shows earning as 0. Please clarify on this. Does it have to payout in order for their earning to show a number?7) Is there auto-payout ? How does payout work if the user paid through stripe or other methods. We see a manual payout in the admin. Does admin have to manually use their bank account details, do bank transfer and then click payout for each vendor or is there a way to connect razorpay or stripe payouts to auto-pay to vendors upon meeting a certain amount or time ?",

                "message": "Hi potatomagnet,1. It\u2019s correct because different providers can have different amounts of commissions. What you have seen in the above screenshot shows provider-wise earnings, and there is also a label called admin earning, which is 7700. So, that\u2019s correct. This is a demo for different providers having different commission rates:https://prnt.sc/J6fpMxMpF6Je2. We\u2019ll investigate this issue and address it in the upcoming update.3. It\u2019s because the Advanced Payment Flow is made this way: the user pays some fraction of the amount while booking, and the remaining amount is paid when the service is completed. But if you want to customise, we can modify this feature to fulfill your requirements.4. Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We have noted this point and will try to implement this feature in a future update.5. In the current flow, the user can cancel it, but we can customise this feature to fulfill your requirements.6. Yes, it shows when admin pays out to the provider.7. In the current version, auto-payout is not implemented, but we can customise this feature to fulfill your requirements."

                "message": "1) But how is 30% commission set by admin here gets the admin 70% commission and the provider 30% ? Question is not on different commission rates for different providers. That is not an issue. My question is regarding the commission amount difference. Here if the admin has set for this provider as 30%, how are they making 70%. By this logic, admin will make more money than the provider because provider\u2019s money is going to admin and admin\u2019s money is going to provider. That is a major issue.2) I deleted all my previous order for this test. Here\u2019s the new issue:I added Rs.10,000 to wallet as a user, booked a vendor\u2019s gig order of Rs.10,000 by making advance payment of Rs.9500. Provider rejected the order. Now the money debited from the user account went back to the user. That\u2019s correct. But I booked the same gig of the provider again of Rs.10,000, and made the provider accept the order, finished the order by paying balance of Rs.500 as the user. Now in the earnings tab \u2013 It should show that the provider earned Rs.10,000 \u2013 30% ( admin commission) = Rs.7000, which is what I should payout, but it shows 20,000 as total earning, 14,000 as admin earning and 6000 as provider earning. How is this correct? The cancelled order is also added here and I\u2019m not able to correct this and I\u2019m not able to even payout the correct amount because the save button is greyed out if the amount is exactly as not in that table.Here\u2019s the screenshots:The cancelled order even shows as pending here, instead of rejected or cancelled:https://prnt.sc/vBfO2ZaEtjiRhttps://prnt.sc/P5ulYbzOeTHThttps://prnt.sc/tsnEhxIwK61BEarnings page:https://prnt.sc/A1W3Y6J-FSo3"

Yes, Provider can have multiple Handymen.3. Which service you are talking about? Please elaborate.4. No, Its not the necessary to setup provider to setup handyman, because Provider can become handyman him self in booking system for that you need to register all handyman as provider then they can assign them self as handyman.5.

What I want to avoid is that if a provider company does an expensive job, and the client pays in cash, that the provider does not need to send all the money to the admin, because that money is his, the ideal option would be to only pay that 10% with credit card, bank transfer or discount in the provider\u2019s wallet in next jobs. I hope you understand me.The way it is for credit card payments is fine, since the admin received the payment from the clients, then he can deduct 10% and pay only 90% to the provider, which is what he is entitled to. I realized that if I put 90% in commission to the supplier it would work the way I want it to.*It would be good that the provider can add his own bank account from the App."

If the Provider receives the cash payment from the customer, I do not see the sense that the Provider pay the full amount to the admin, because if the platform charges 10% for the service to the Providers, ideally the Provider should pay only 10% of the cash received from the customer and keeps the 90% that belongs to him.

In my case Stripe will charge 2.9% + .30cents + 1DOP currency exchange rate. So a mechanism where we can add fees on top of the TopUp amount would be great.Edit: I achieved it by modifying the user_wallet_balance_screen.dart. with the following code for anyone interested (assuming you\u2019re using stripe as payment gateway)// Calculate the total amount with the 3% fee double originalAmount = walletAmountCont.text.toDouble(); double feeAmount = originalAmount * 0.03; // 3% fee double totalAmount = originalAmount + feeAmount; StripeServiceNew stripeServiceNew = StripeServiceNew( isTest: currentPaymentMethod!.isTest == 1, stripePaymentKey: key, stripeURL: stripeURL, totalAmount: totalAmount, stripePaymentPublishKey: stripePaymentPublishKey, onComplete: (p0) { Map req = { \u201camount\u201d: totalAmount, // Use the total amount with the fee \u201ctransaction_type\u201d: PAYMENT_METHOD_STRIPE, \u201ctransaction_id\u201d: p0[\u2018transaction_id\u2019] };walletTopUp(req);\n  },\n);\niqonicdesign\niqonicdesign AUTHOR17 days ago Flag\nHi dear, thank you for your suggestion.

We would greatly appreciate it if you could review them and assess the feasibility of incorporating them into the next version:1. Regrettably, the customer, provider, and admin applications lack support for the Spanish language. Currently, language modification is limited to the website admin interface exclusively.2. A crucial feature that is currently absent is the ability to assign distinct commissions for each payment method. Given that payment gateways impose varying commission charges, it is imperative to introduce a differentiation in commission rates between gateway payments and cash transactions.3. We have identified the absence of an option to specify a 0% VAT rate, which is an essential requirement for accurate taxation calculations.4. The inability to modify additional charges poses a significant limitation in accommodating dynamic pricing adjustments.5. A critical aspect missing from the app is the provision for recurring charges, specifically for monthly subscription services offered by providers.6. Furthermore, the app lacks the capability to establish a hybrid commission structure that combines both a percentage-based component and a fixed amount.We eagerly anticipate your evaluation of these proposed corrections and whether they can be seamlessly integrated into the next app version. Your prompt attention to this matter is sincerely appreciated.",

The purpose is, providers can showcase their work in social media style to entice users. BUT i\u2019m still learning flutter so everything is running local as im using pexels video link. I was thinking of using the sliders  for which users can click on the video which is link to a promotion service by the providers but sadly the slider in the backend only allow images. SO do you think that\u2019s something you guys can allow on the app?  because it would cool to let providers show how they perform their work, even if admin is the one who can upload videos only,  that would make users spend more time on the app. by the way I tried using fiirebasse storage for this implementation and it is slowwwwwww each videos take 3-5 seconds to load.",

How to plan management for provider/handyman to subscribe ? I can not find any menu from handyman/provider/admin page.3. How this plan can give plus/minus to the handyman/provider? for example: if take bronze plan then provider can have 5 customers, else if take silver then provider can have 10 customers, else if gold then provider can have 20 customers.4.Unread number icon in chat box seem not reduced after user read the message.

This aspect of the workflow may also be handled by a client raising a dispute.",

Not to mention that Apple keeps adding newer and more strict laws to pre-emptively avoid fines.That said, users who try to publish new apps are certain to run into the same roadblock as listed above. It has been brought to my attention that the provision of Live Chat is also considered an avenue for User Generated Content (UGC) and justifies the requirement for users to be able to block as well as report offensive users to provide a safe space for users of the Apple Store.I am unhappy with their decision, however they are unrelenting and refusing to budge in spite of an appeal requesting they allow the app whilst the features are being implemented. Thus we are unable to make any progress till this feature comes live.Kindly accord it the priority it deserves. Even if the next update can have a mild version of the features. That will be great."

I noticed on the premade plans that are included in app, the first plan has a 7 day free trial, but I don\u2019t see anywhere to configure it or make new plans with a free trial.5) signup flow for providers is strange.

Provider should be able to login to at least submit required verification documents and then admin can approve.6) Login with wrong credentials on web page shows correect \u201cThese credentials do not match our records.\u201d but in the app it just shows \u201c400: bad request\u201d",

Handymay and Provider mobile apps are around 140 mb in size. This means that when the space on the phone is low, the possibility of deletion increases. Can it be made smaller?\n7.

Admin x Provider x user WITHOUT the update folders its very very very confusingwhen you are supposed to fork and merge it yourself then package it as one with the update before submitting to code canyon. not give us hours of work to open each and every folder inside of a folder inside of a folder it makes me very dizzy trying to so. ESPECIALLY when this app already has 4 separate applications inside that we already have to merge to get one app1. this is my first time building and purchasing the app im not an old customer upgrading the app from an old installation so i deserve a fresh 8.0 not to go back and fix and merge your files. the file i just downloaded includes SEVERAL update folders. please fix this and send us a proper zip with 1 admin = already updated 1 provider = already updated 1 user = already updated in the package.this is very important. please fix the architecture",

Rooms 2, and Bathroom 3  and the price will be adjusted according to customers selection and quantity.  these extras are not services that can be purchased solo like you have in this update.   keep up the good work but please this logic to the app because your competitors have it but with poor design.

It\u2019s seems very confusing to me and probably my potential users.Handyman needs Providers to assign work to them otherwise they cannot work.

It\u2019s very confusing, especially to someone who wants to signup. How and where do I even explain that to them? there is no where to give users a heads up on the difference between Provider and Handyman before they register, no option to request account type change either. I mean, you just assume people registering on the app will automatically understand this?Then admin has to spend hours assigning Handyman to Providers manually not knowing whether the Provider even need or want another Handyman. Admin is basically force a Handyman unto the Provider? And also admin decides the commission the Provider is to pay that Handyman? How does that make sense?At the very least, you could add a new page where Providers can see the list of unassigned Handyman and choose the ones they want by themselves removing a load of work to admin or just remove Handyman registration and let them just sign in after added by Provider.I don\u2019t know, maybe I don\u2019t understand the reason behind all this, or maybe you have plans in the future that will add more sense to your flow.

Then we proceed to connect them together but we basically handle the process.\nUp until that moment, the home owner cannot contact the handyman directly except we initiate the process. Customers are required to submit their home needs and we do the proper match with an handyman within their location \n2.    Our clients (who have to be on a yearly subscription) have access to an online vault where they can upload important receipt in the case of a disaster \n3.    Can we connect a tab that goes to the real estate web page of our site?\n4.    On the app, we are looking at having  2 distinct subscription service (multi-subscription) , is this achievable\n5.

This could prevent for users (customers) to contact provider/handyman outside the platform avoiding the commission for the use of the platform.2.- Advertisement: I know there are an ads module on the roadmap but it could be useful that every service category page has it own slider for custom ads (like the slider of the main page/screen).Also could monetize results from the search function, so providers/handymans could pay to appear within the first 10 results from a search related of his service for a specific period of time (example 1 month of first results in searches paying $3 USD)I\u2019m going to buy this script in this week.

And also we should able to save it and then when should able use it for next bookings. And in the message screen we should see last message in the top. Other thing it should display pictures of the users instead of first letter of users. And we should able to send pictures in the message. One more thing also other potential customer mentioned which is the self employed provider. Or better thing to allow the handyman add his service but if he is not depended to a company or provider.
